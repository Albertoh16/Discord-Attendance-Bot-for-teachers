# Discord-Attendance-Bot-for-teachers
This is a Disocrd bot which saves time for educators using the discord application as a classroom by having their attendance automated and sent to them privately in a text document along side the date and server name. 

The bot has the following commands:

- (-auto), which goes through every voice channel inside a server and marks those in the call present while marking those who aren't in the call absent.
- (-manual) which would require students to reply to a message the bot will send and within a certain amount of time, the bot will mark the students who replied present while marking those who haven't absent. (I am currently working on this function)

This is the link used to invite the bot into your server: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1075198552638242876&permissions=274877908992&scope=bot
